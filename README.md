Time tracking for students, including test milestones and progress reporting.
## Why call it cyndorbloq?
Within the fictional World of Greyhawk (the default setting for Dungeons & Dragons), Cyndor is the god of Time, Infinity and Continuity to the Oeridian people. Cyndor's mortal followers hold the belief that all of time is a path along a predestined lifeline that Cyndor has already foreseen.

A cinderblock is a building block made from cast concrete and either fly ash or bottom ash (hence the 'cinder'). They are valued for their strength, low production cost, and relatively light weight.

cyndorbloq, then, is a combination of these two concepts. We seek to provide a sense of direction to students and teachers of martial arts that is customizable, secure, and light.
